	  					<p>Hummingbirds, bats, bees, beetles, butterflies, and flies that carry pollen from one plant to another as they collect nectar play a crucial role in flowering plant reproduction and in the production of most fruits and vegetables.</p>

	  					<p>A recent study of the status of pollinators in North America by the National Academy of Sciences found that populations of honey bees (which are not native to North America) and some wild pollinators are declining.</p>

	  				<div class="content-row-three">
							<p>Declines in wild pollinators may be a result of habitat loss and degradation, while declines in managed bees is linked to disease (introduced parasites and pathogens). Over 75% of all flowering plants are pollinated by animals.
